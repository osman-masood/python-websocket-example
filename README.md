What is this?
==========

This is for getting the 'top' command to stream to your mobile/desktop browser. It uses Flask + gevent websockets. It's based off of the repo by tzangms, which is based off of a blog post by this one French guy.

How to?
==========

run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install requirements, and start the server with `python runserver.py` then browse `http://localhost:8000/` to try out.

Edit 'ENTER PASSWORD HERE' in app.js and websocket.py to change the password. Also, you can change the port from 8000 to whatever you want.
